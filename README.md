# NumberGuessingGame
A simple number guessing game that can be played locally. Use the server to generate the number while other users try to guess it.


Note: Don't try to use this code in a serious game since the hidden number is sent over htpp in plaintext, a user can capture it to win everytime.

I still want to experiment more with this so it may not be the last form of the game.
